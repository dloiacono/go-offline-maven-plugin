# Changelog

## 1.2.8

- [#23](https://github.com/qaware/go-offline-maven-plugin/issues/23) Fixed a bug where only one version of a plugin
  would be fetched if multiple versions of the same plugin where part of the build

## 1.2.7

- [#22](https://github.com/qaware/go-offline-maven-plugin/issues/22) Added \<type\> attribute to DynamicDependency

## 1.2.6

- [#20](https://github.com/qaware/go-offline-maven-plugin/issues/20) Validate the user provided DynamicDependency
  configuration and print an error to help the user fix the configuration if it is incorrect.

## 1.2.6

- fixed: Errors when downloading dependencies completely skipped the download of plugins.

## 1.2.4

- [#16](https://github.com/qaware/go-offline-maven-plugin/issues/16) fixed attachedArtifacts with different types/extensions than the main artifact not recognized as part of the reactor build.
- [#16](https://github.com/qaware/go-offline-maven-plugin/issues/16) fixed: 'IgnoreArtifactDescriptorRepositories' flag was always set to true instead of using maven provided value. This could lead to  unresolvable artifacts if a dependency declared an additional repository.
